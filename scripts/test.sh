Usage: scripts/test.sh [--suites LIST] [--arch ARCH] [VAR=VAL ...]

The canonical test entry: identical in local CI, PR CI, dry run and release.
DEFAULT (no --suites) is exactly what CI runs: static contract checks
(Step 0a-0t), a CLEAN sanitizer build, every suite via the parallel harness,
then the prod-binary regression guards (Steps 4-6).

Modes:
  (default)      The venue leg. Clean build (scripts/clean.sh) + all suites +
                 all contract steps. This is the shape every gate runs.
  --suites LIST  ITERATION mode: comma- or space-separated suite names, e.g.
                 --suites daemon,daemon_ipc. Rebuilds the test-runner
                 INCREMENTALLY (make dependency tracking, no clean) and runs
                 only those suites — seconds, not minutes. Skips the contract
                 steps and prod-binary guards; the full default run remains
                 the merge gate. Suite names: build/c/test-runner --list-suites.
  --tsan         ThreadSanitizer leg (data-race gate): builds and runs the
                 widened TSan runner via make test-tsan — the same leg CI's
                 tsan jobs and the compose test-tsan service run.

Options:
  --arch ARCH    Force target arch (arm64 | x86_64), e.g. under Rosetta.
  -h, --help     This text.

Make passthrough (VAR=VAL, forwarded verbatim):
  CC= CXX=       Compiler override, e.g. CC=gcc-14 CXX=g++-14.
  BUILD_DIR=     Build in an isolated directory (containers/sanitizer variants).
  SANITIZE=      Override sanitizer flags. Platform defaults when unset:
                 unix/CLANG64 use the Makefile's ASan+UBSan test flags;
                 CLANGARM64 (Windows on ARM, no ASan runtime) gets CI's
                 trap-UBSan set (-fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize-trap=undefined
                 -fstack-protector-strong -fno-omit-frame-pointer) applied HERE
                 so local and CI build identical test binaries. Pass SANITIZE=
                 (empty) for a plain build when debugging a trap.

Environment:
  CBM_TEST_SEQUENTIAL=1   Single-process runner instead of the parallel harness.
  CBM_RUN_HANG_TEST=1     Opt-in C++ index-hang regression (#410, needs prod).
  CBM_NO_CCACHE=1         Disable the content-verified compiler cache.
  CBM_TEST_SHARD/_LEG     Set by CI's sharded legs; leave unset locally.

Examples:
  scripts/test.sh                          # the full venue leg (what CI runs)
  scripts/test.sh --suites daemon_ipc      # one suite, incremental, seconds
  scripts/test.sh --suites "arena hash_table" CC=clang CXX=clang++
  scripts/test.sh SANITIZE= --suites daemon_ipc # plain build for trap debugging

# reliably green locally against a seam-bearing binary, but on every CI leg the
# forced mismatch raises no cohort conflict at all: the seam is present (the
# test asserts that up front), the forced fingerprint is well-formed (64 hex),
# and `daemon status` reports an active daemon on a DIFFERENT build - yet the
# client joins silently. Until that local-vs-CI divergence in the cohort
# admission path is understood, gating on it would make an unexplained red, and
# skipping it silently would hide the gap. Run it by hand:
