# check-binary-composition.sh — release gate: assert what must NOT be inside a
# shipped artifact.
#
# Microsoft Defender's ML classifier flagged the v0.9.1-rc.1 binaries. The
# hardening pass that followed removed capability or opaque asset bytes — an
# executable stack, an in-process updater, test-only environment seams,
# embedded integration programs, and the in-image frontend bundle. Each of
# those regresses invisibly: one restored #include, one Makefile source-list
# edit, one revived call site, and nothing else in CI notices — the binary just
# quietly restores capability or opaque bytes that this hardening boundary is
# intended to exclude. Their removal reduces attack surface and makes release
# contents independently inspectable; it does not establish which feature, if
# any, caused an opaque third-party ML verdict.
#
# This script is the proof that each removal stayed removed. The needle scans
# assert NEGATIVE properties (needle absent), plus one canary string we know
# ships, because an absence check aimed at the wrong file — a compressed
# artifact, a stub, a truncated download — would otherwise pass vacuously and
# read green. The A1* checks assert structural properties of the produced ELF
# instead, for the mirror-image reason: a linker flag that was accepted is not
# evidence that the binary gained anything, so the mitigation is measured in
# the artifact. A missing tool is a hard error on both sides: a skipped
# assertion must never look like a satisfied one.
#
# Usage: scripts/ci/check-binary-composition.sh <binary-or-dir>...
#   Directories are scanned recursively; format (ELF / Mach-O / PE) is detected
#   per file from its magic bytes and each assertion runs where it is
#   meaningful. Exit 0 = every assertion passed, 1 = at least one failed,
#   2 = usage error, missing tool, or nothing checkable was found (a vacuous
#   run is a failure, not a pass).
#   CBM_COMPOSITION_FIXTURE=1 declares the target a packaging FIXTURE (a stub
#   compiled by a contract test, not a release link): A1d-bind-now is then
#   reported n/a instead of asserted, because eager binding is a property of
#   the release link flags, not of the packaging path the fixture exercises.
#   Only contract tests set it; release derivation never does.
