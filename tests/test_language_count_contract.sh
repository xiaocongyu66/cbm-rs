# The published language count IS the number of vendored tree-sitter grammars,
# and every public surface must agree with it.
#
# Why this exists: the count was hand-maintained on seven separate surfaces, so
# it drifted apart from reality AND from itself — README/docs/npm said 158 while
# server.json/nuspec/package-release.sh said 159.
#
# Why grammars and not CBM_LANG_COUNT: the registry contains entries with no
# parser at all. CBM_LANG_NIM (grammar removed 2026-06-12) and
# CBM_LANG_OBJECTSCRIPT_EXPORT have no grammar directory, no tree_sitter
# function and no MANIFEST row, yet files still route to them by extension.
# Counting them would publish languages we do not parse. A vendored grammar
# directory, by contrast, demonstrably exists and is checksum-gated.
#
# Known and accepted: this UNDERCOUNTS languages that share one grammar
# (TypeScript/TSX, objectscript_udl/_routine). We publish the number we can
# prove rather than the larger number we cannot.
